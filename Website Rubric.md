# Basic Web Rubric
Any functioning website should be capable of the first four requirements, while any good website should be able to fulfill all six requirements.
# Network
-. Connectivity: Ability to connect to the website
Before having any good website, web users must be able to connect to the website through the Internet or via other network means. Connectivity demands a website to be available at any time it is required (usually at all hours of the day). The website’s network should be resistant and capable to handle sporadic flows of network traffic.
# Structure
-. Index / Connected Pages
Before building a website one should consider how web pages connect to each other, most often each page is connected to one another; however, depending on the circumstances the website may follow a different design.
## Layout
Each web page should have an easy to understand layout that takes care to provide for the content found within. This means making sure text is in paragraphs or pictures are properly wrapped.
-. Header
The header is the top element of a web page and should house the nav bar, logo, and any other important information to be first seen.
-. Navigation NavBar / Home Button
Each website should have a navbar to make moving to different pages easy. For a good website the navbar should be easy to understand/navigate. Those designing websites should consider if they want their navbar to be “sticky” and follow the user as they scroll through the webpage.
-. Footer
The footer is the bottom element of a web page that should house the sitemap or other important information, often this a space is for legal information or to allow users to understand the website more, e.g., an “About Us” link, an address/contact info, copyright information, etc.
# Functionality
Because no two computers of web users are the exact same, each may have different experiences when it comes to accessing a website.
-. Device Accessibility
The website should consider what devices may connect to it; different screen sizes may distort what is intended to be seen by the user. The website may look good on a desktop, but if it's not built to scale then it might look broken on a smaller device like a smartphone. Device accessibility also should consider if certain devices are capable of running the website properly when it comes to the website’s moving parts, e.g., having Flash/Java or running videos.
-. Human Interface
It is not enough for the connecting device to be able to interact with the website, but the human user should be able to interact with the website. This means that the website should cater to the diverse or unique needs of users, e.g., built for colorblind or vision impaired, have captions for pictures, easy to click buttons, etc.
# Theme
A good website should have a nice looking aesthetic that is pleasing to the eyes. It shouldn’t be a white background page with boring text or look like an old website.
-. Styling (CSS)
Webpages should have a unified style that is seen across the whole website.
-. Favicon/Logo
A good website should have a unique favicon (the tiny pictures that are found next to the tab name) and a recognizable logo/home button.
-. Domain Name
A good website should have a recognizable domain name that is easy to remember and go back to.
Good example: www.google.com
Bad example: www.not-@-gr3at?V=idea.com
# Code
Rather than looking at what's presented outwardly, a good website should also look inwardly at its own code. The code HTML/CSS of a website should be clean and understandable for those who are working on the website and built with courtesy for future individuals who may build upon what was made.
# Security
All good websites should have security, this involves preventing unwanted changes or unwanted access to the host server of the website. It should also consider the security of the website’s network.
