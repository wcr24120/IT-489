# Basic Web Rubric
Presented here is a web rubric that I have designed based on my own knowledge of IT and websites, thus it makes use of scholarly sources and should not be an authoratative guide for what makes a good website. With that said, this paper intends to discuss not just the look of a website, but also intends to discuss the interconnecting components that make a good website, such as network necessities or security. Any functioning website should be capable of the first four requirements, while any good website should be able to fulfill all six requirements.
# Network
This section of the rubric takes into account the network capabilities of a website. While there are various types of websites, it must be understood that before a website may become a "website" it has to be able to connect to the Internet or be hosted on a web server; otherwise, it is nothing more than a collection of files. How the webmaster decides to build the website is up to them and may change how they approach connecting a website to the internet. Different network approaches involve using Filezilla to upload your web pages to a server, making use of cloud services like AWS, or having a website built with Google Sites and ignoring the need to set up a network yourself. 
### Connectivity: Ability to connect to the website
Connectivity is a websites ability to allow users to connect to it.
- Connectivity demands a website to be available at any time it is required (usually at all hours of the day). 
- The website’s network should be resistant and capable to handle sporadic flows of network traffic.
# Structure
The structure of a website is important and demands a well thoughout foundation to hold itself together. This section describes web structure and what elements should be considered when designing it.
- Index / Connected Pages
Before building a website one should consider how web pages connect to each other, most often each page is connected to one another; however, depending on the circumstances the website may follow a different design.
### Layout
Each web page should have an easy to understand layout that takes care to provide for the content found within. This means making sure text is in paragraphs or pictures are properly wrapped.
- Header
The header is the top element of a web page and should house the nav bar, logo, and any other important information to be first seen.
- Navigation NavBar / Home Button
Each website should have a navbar to make moving to different pages easy. For a good website the navbar should be easy to understand/navigate. Those designing websites should consider if they want their navbar to be “sticky” and follow the user as they scroll through the webpage.
- Footer
The footer is the bottom element of a web page that should house the sitemap or other important information, often this a space is for legal information or to allow users to understand the website more, e.g., an “About Us” link, an address/contact info, copyright information, etc.
### Functionality
Because no two computers of web users are the exact same, each may have different experiences when it comes to accessing a website.
### Device Interface
The website should consider what devices may connect to it; different screen sizes may distort what is intended to be seen by the user. The website may look good on a desktop, but if it's not built to scale then it might look broken on a smaller device like a smartphone. Device accessibility also should consider if certain devices are capable of running the website properly when it comes to the website’s moving parts, e.g., having Flash/Java or running videos.
### Human Interface
It is not enough for the connecting device to be able to interact with the website, but the human user should be able to interact with the website. This means that the website should cater to the diverse or unique needs of users, e.g., built for colorblind or vision impaired, have captions for pictures, easy to click buttons, etc.
# Theme
A good website should have a nice looking aesthetic that is pleasing to the eyes. It shouldn’t be a white background page with boring text or look like an old website. This rule is for general websites, and can change depending on the type of website your trying to make. A plain white theme with generic text might make sense for a file sharing site where readability and formality is more important than looking good.

### Styling (CSS)
Webpages should have a unified style that is seen across the whole website; the style should make users believe they are on the same website. This is typically done with navbars and the background color, which shouldn't differ on various web pages.
### Favicon/Logo
A good website should have a unique favicon (the tiny pictures that are found next to the tab name) and a recognizable logo/home button. This tiny touch helps with the branding of the website, and are nice to look at. It also helps users who may have multiple tabs open and cannot read what their tab titles present to them.
### Domain Name
A good website should have a recognizable domain name that is easy to remember and go back to. It should also be easy to type.
- Good example: www.google.com
- Bad example: www.not-@-gr3at?V=idea.com
# Code
Rather than looking at what's presented outwardly, a good website should also look inwardly at its own code. The code HTML/CSS of a website should be clean and understandable for those who are working on the website and built with courtesy for future individuals who may build upon what was made. The code of the website should also have what is strictly necessary for the website and should be removed of any comments that shouldn't be seen by web viewers.
# Security
All good websites should have security, this involves preventing unwanted changes or unwanted access to the host server of the website. It should also consider the security of the website’s network.
# Concluding Remarks
This concludes the Web Rubric. While some of these elements are not necessary for a website, they are definitley something to consider for a good website.
